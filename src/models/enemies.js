    killText: 'Using his fashionably sultry fishnet stockings, Benson fashions a quite literal fishnet. The Cuddlefish sheds a single tear as it hurtles into the nearby pond, tangled in a lanky web of legwear. The bean lies unguarded. Benson\'s stomach lets out a low rumble.'

The plaque reads "Awarded to Lieutenant Jimbo: Quickest Shot In The West. Nazi Quickdraw Tournament, 1998." The man is eyeballing Benson now. His eyes fall to the luger on his belt. Jimbo\'s right hand twitches.',

    killText: 'Jimbo drew, but Benson drew quicker, and now Jimbo lies slumped in his folding chair, just totally riddled with staples. It takes a lot of staples to put a man down, especially from a distance with a staple gun, but Benson is famished and really wants to wrap this up. Benson places the staple gun on a nearby shelf, as it ran out of staples. That\'s how many staples it took - all the staples. Jimbo\'s luger shines in the light from its new home on the floor.'

The voice belongs to none other than the Nazi King Glaärg, Benson\'s sworn enemy. "Ï vïll ënjöy zïs Ämërïcän trëät rïght nöw ïn frönt öf yöür vëry öwn ëyës!" It ain\'t right. It ain\'t just. This clown has Benson\'s burger in one hand, and he rests his other on the gatling gun\'s crank, beginning to turn it as he leans in for a bite of Benson\'s all-American beef disc.',
    weakness: 'Luger',
    killText: 'Benson wastes no time, and as the gatling gun\'s first few bullets scream past him, narrowly missing his adorable puggle ears, he takes aim with Jimbo\'s luger and pulls the trigger. There is a moment of heavy silence, broken by the sound of a perfectly toasted bun landing softly on the seat of the throne. Glaärg lets out a final gasp, "Nö. Nööööööö!" and falls to the floor. Benson does a cool cowboy gun twirl, but trips over his own feet and the luger flies out the window to the world below.'
