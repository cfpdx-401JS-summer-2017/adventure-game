# Feed The Tiger

By [Anwar Montasir](https://github.com/anwarmontasir) and [Pierre Shabani](https://github.com/jshabani)

## Description

You are a character in a maze. In every room you will have choices of direction to travel (Up, Down, Left, Right).

In some rooms you will interact with other characters, and exchange objects.

Your goal is to feed the tiger, the guardian of the maze and exit through the door behind him.

## How the maze works

At any given moments your options are 

- Move Up
- Move Down
- Move Right
- Move Left
- Pick up an item, provided there is one on the ground.
- Drop an item, if you're carrying anything.
- Use an item, if you're carrying anything.
- Speak, if you encounter another character.
