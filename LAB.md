===

Create a component based adventure game! For this assignment you'll be creating a 
an adventure game ala Zork or choose your own adventure, or whatever you dream up.

**Work in teams of 2 for this project**

* This game should have _at least_ five rooms or scenes that the player can move between. 

* Have at least one item that the player can interact and at least one monster or character
the player defeats or interacts with.

* You need to provide ways for user to specify what they want to do (button, input, etc) 

* Test your components with snapshot testing

* You haven't yet learned how to use things like a router or some of the higher level state management
techniques available in React. Just use what you know plus JavaScript know-how to orchestrate changes through the game.

* The goal is to jump into React and try and build something more complex!

## Bonus

* Persist the data in localStorage to survive a browser refresh

## Rubric
* Functionally Correct (not buggy) *5pts*
* Game Creativity *5pts*
* Idiomatic use of React: *5pts*
* React Components and Functions: *5pts*
